    While editing the A CSS file we inserted a picture, adding a color background and altering the image to fit best. The font family of the header was edited: to serif with a shadow effect, changed the color to blue, and underlined the header. Futhermore, we changed the font of the table lettering by applying Times New Roman to it. For the links we changed the coloring to hotpink for them to stand out more after adding a yellow background color to the table, which we also added a green border to it for the aesthetic.   </p1>

    <h1>B Repository
    </h1>
        <p1>
            On the B CSS we added a new font to the header, and added a cool shadow color that makes it pop a bit. On the tables instead it the headers being centered we moved them to the left so that they would be easier to read. As well as changing the headers we added borders around the table to make the table more eye appealing. Also, we changed the font to make the table more appealing to the eye. We also added a background image we let repeat all over the page, because of this it made the table hard to read, to compensate for that we changed the background color of the table to make the table easy to read. Lastly I decreased the image's size to make the picture look more appealing.
